    <p>In the beginning, the guests of the waterfall were mainly aristocrats, for their sake the first taverns and guest houses were built. Tourism became more accessible as a result of the construction of canals in the first half of the 19th century, and then with the advent of railways. The development of tourism on the Canadian coast was more intensive - numerous hotels and souvenir shops were opened here, the first museums of this country appeared. Contributed to the development of appropriate infrastructure and the fact that the coastline near the waterfall remained in state ownership. Industry began to develop on the American coast: plants and factories were built here, using water energy with the help of diversion channels.<br>If you are interested write to our instagram:<strong>linlifxee</strong>
