        <p> <strong>On this January 28, I had a very excited day,</strong> because I went to a restaurant with a friend and her boyfriend. Finding a common topic with a friend is not a problem, but finding a common topic with her boyfriend was a problem. Well, now of course we are students We can talk about school or work. But when you discuss everything, your conversation ends. But then it is very difficult to start something. I felt like a third wheel. And after the restaurant I hurried to the university to avoid them and complete my unfinished business.</p>
